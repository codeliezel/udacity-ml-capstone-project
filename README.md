# Dog Breed Classifer(CNN) - (Udacity Machine Learning Capstone Project)

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a classifer that would classify or identify a particular dog's breed.

## Project Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

   ```
   	git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
   	cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification
   ```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.

   ```
   	jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
   ```
